- <b>Jupyter Notebooks </b>

<h2>Techniques Used </h2>

- <b>Simple Linear Regression</b>
 </b>

<h2>Project walk-through or samples:</h2>

To use, import the module after placing the file in your active directory as follows: 
from residualplots import diagnostic_plots
and then build the model in Statsmodels and run the diagnostic plots. An example of this is shown [in the notebook file here](https://github.com/AaronShepanik/Residual-Plots/blob/main/Residual%20Plots%20in%20Python/sampleplots.ipynb)
